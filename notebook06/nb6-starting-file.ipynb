Therefore, there is no earlier data available in the nonbinary category.\" Something to note is that these datasets are supposed to represent the same information. However, because UCR utilized two methods of representing the `\"Gender\"` column, it may not be completely appropriate to compare the raw numbers of the values alone -- some of the individuals who are in the `\"Nonbinary\"` or `\"Unknown\"` category in this dataset were likely placed into the `\"Female\"` or `\"Male\"` categories in the other dataset. Therefore, the numbers could be a bit skewed, and it may be beneficial to compare by proportions as an additional step."

Ultimately, it is typically very hard to encode data about humans into numbers and categories, **because in doing so, we lose information and context about the individual we are looking at.** In your analysis in the future, try to strike a balance of looking at interesting trends in the data and considering the original context of the data you're working with."
